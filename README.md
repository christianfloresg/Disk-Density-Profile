# Disk-Density-Profile
 This script plots the azimuthal averaged density profile of disks vs radius. This code is mean to investigate gaps or rings in disks in addition to compare the density profiles of several disks. This code uses in part the Go Fish code.

 The code assumes that Go Fish is installed. If that is not the case, please try: pip install gofish

 The code also assumes that one has observations of a disk that is centered in the middle of the fits image.
